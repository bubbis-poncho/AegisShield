# AegisShield Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Data Integrity is Paramount
The system MUST ensure data is accurate, consistent, and trustworthy. All data ingestion, transformation, and resolution processes MUST be transactional, auditable, and have mechanisms for error handling and reconciliation. 

**Rationale**: As a security and threat intelligence platform, data integrity forms the foundation of all analysis and decision-making. Compromised data integrity leads to false positives, missed threats, and eroded trust.

### II. Scalability and Performance
The architecture MUST be designed to handle massive data volumes and high-velocity event streams in real-time. Services MUST be horizontally scalable, and queries MUST be optimized for low-latency responses, particularly for the interactive investigation UI.

**Rationale**: Security events occur at massive scale and require immediate response. System performance directly impacts threat detection effectiveness and analyst productivity.

### III. Modular and Maintainable Code
Services MUST be loosely coupled and highly cohesive, communicating through well-defined APIs and message queues. Code MUST be clean, well-documented, and follow established design patterns to ensure long-term maintainability.

**Rationale**: Security platforms evolve rapidly with emerging threats. Modular architecture enables quick adaptation, reduces deployment risks, and facilitates team collaboration.

### IV. Comprehensive Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every service MUST have a robust testing suite, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. A continuous integration (CI) pipeline MUST automatically run tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

**Rationale**: Security platforms cannot afford failures or unexpected behavior. Comprehensive testing is essential for system reliability and confidence in threat detection capabilities.

### V. Consistent and Intuitive User Experience
The front-end MUST provide a consistent, responsive, and intuitive interface for analysts. Complex data MUST be visualized clearly, and workflows for investigation MUST be efficient and user-centric.

**Rationale**: Analyst effectiveness directly impacts security posture. Poor UX leads to missed threats, slower response times, and analyst fatigue during critical incidents.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- All code MUST pass automated linting and formatting checks
- Code coverage MUST meet minimum thresholds established per component
- Security scanning MUST be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline
- Database migrations MUST be reversible and tested

### API Design Standards
- All APIs MUST follow RESTful principles with OpenAPI specifications
- Event schemas MUST be versioned and backward-compatible
- Rate limiting and authentication MUST be implemented consistently
- Error responses MUST include actionable information for debugging

### Performance Requirements
- API responses MUST complete within 200ms for interactive queries
- Batch processing MUST handle minimum 10,000 events per second
- System MUST maintain <1% data loss during peak loads
- UI interactions MUST respond within 100ms for user actions

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and standards. All code reviews, architectural decisions, and feature implementations MUST verify compliance with these principles.

Amendments to this constitution require:
1. Documentation of the proposed change and rationale
2. Assessment of impact on existing systems and workflows  
3. Approval from the technical leadership team
4. Migration plan for affected components

Complexity that violates these principles MUST be justified with specific technical requirements and approved exceptions. Teams MUST use established patterns and libraries that align with these principles.
