# Implementation Plan: Data Intelligence and Investigation Platform

**Branch**: `003-build-a-data` | **Date**: 2025-09-20 | **Spec**: [link](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-build-a-data/spec.md`

## Summary
Building a comprehensive data intelligence and investigation platform for financial crimes analysis. The system will ingest data from multiple sources, perform entity resolution, generate real-time alerts for suspicious activities, and provide an interactive graph-based investigation interface. The platform uses a three-tier microservices architecture with Next.js frontend, API gateway, and containerized backend services running on Kubernetes.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Go 1.21+ (core services), Python 3.11+ (data science), TypeScript/Next.js 14+ (frontend)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Kubernetes, Apache Kafka, gRPC, Next.js, Shadcn UI, Zustand, TanStack Query, Cytoscape.js  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL 15+, Neo4j 5+, Apache Doris, Apache Kafka, AWS S3/GCP Cloud Storage with Iceberg  
**Testing**: Go test, pytest, Jest/Playwright, Testcontainers for integration tests  
**Target Platform**: Kubernetes clusters (cloud-native), container-first deployment  
**Project Type**: web - Three-tier architecture with frontend, API layer, and microservices backend  
**Performance Goals**: 10,000+ transactions/second ingestion, <200ms investigation query response, 99.9% uptime  
**Constraints**: GDPR/PCI compliance, <500ms alert generation, horizontal scaling required, 24/7 operation  
**Scale/Scope**: 100+ million entities, 1B+ relationships, 50+ concurrent analysts, petabyte-scale data processing

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **Data Integrity**: All data flows identified, error handling planned, audit trails designed
  - Kafka for reliable message delivery, PostgreSQL ACID transactions, audit logging throughout pipeline
- [x] **Scalability & Performance**: Architecture handles expected load, horizontal scaling considered, latency targets defined  
  - Kubernetes orchestration, Apache Doris for OLAP, Neo4j clustering, microservices can scale independently
- [x] **Modular Code**: Services loosely coupled, APIs well-defined, clear separation of concerns
  - Microservices architecture, gRPC contracts, event-driven communication via Kafka
- [x] **Comprehensive Testing**: Test strategy covers unit/integration/e2e, CI pipeline planned, coverage targets set
  - Unit tests per service, Testcontainers for integration, E2E with Playwright, 80%+ coverage target
- [x] **Consistent UX**: User workflows efficient, data visualization clear, interface patterns consistent
  - Shadcn UI design system, Cytoscape.js for graph viz, investigation workflow optimization

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Complex three-tier architecture requires frontend/backend separation

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Tasks Required:
1. **Apache Doris Integration Patterns**: Research best practices for real-time OLAP with Kafka streaming
2. **Neo4j Performance at Scale**: Investigate clustering, sharding strategies for billion+ node graphs  
3. **Entity Resolution Algorithms**: Evaluate ML models for matching entities across disparate data sources
4. **Kubernetes Service Mesh**: Research Istio/Linkerd for microservice communication and observability
5. **Iceberg Table Format**: Validate S3/GCS integration patterns with Apache Iceberg for analytical workloads
6. **Financial Crime Compliance**: Research GDPR, PCI-DSS, AML requirements for data handling and retention
7. **Graph Visualization Performance**: Benchmark Cytoscape.js vs alternatives for large graph rendering
8. **Real-time Stream Processing**: Validate Kafka Streams vs Apache Flink for complex event processing

**Output**: research.md with all architecture decisions validated and alternatives evaluated

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Design Deliverables:
1. **Entity Resolution Data Model**: Define person, organization, transaction, and relationship schemas
2. **API Gateway Contracts**: Design GraphQL/REST endpoints for frontend data aggregation  
3. **gRPC Service Contracts**: Define inter-service communication protocols
4. **Kafka Event Schemas**: Design event-driven message formats between services
5. **Database Schemas**: PostgreSQL tables, Neo4j node/relationship models, Doris star schemas
6. **Investigation Workflow Models**: Define case management and audit trail structures

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- **Infrastructure Setup**: Kubernetes cluster, databases, Kafka cluster, monitoring stack
- **Service Development**: Each microservice as independent task group with contracts-first approach
- **Frontend Development**: Component library, graph visualization, investigation workflows  
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end scenarios validating data flow through entire pipeline
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for ingestion, query performance, graph rendering

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Infrastructure and databases first (PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Kafka, Doris)
- Core services with gRPC contracts (data-ingestion, entity-resolution, alert-engine)
- API gateway aggregating backend services  
- Frontend components consuming API gateway
- Integration testing across full stack
- Performance optimization and monitoring

**Estimated Output**: 40-50 numbered, ordered tasks covering infrastructure, 6 microservices, API gateway, frontend, and testing

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
