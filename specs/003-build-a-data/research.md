# Research: Data Intelligence Platform Architecture

**Date**: 2025-09-20  
**Feature**: Data Intelligence and Investigation Platform  
**Purpose**: Validate architectural decisions and resolve technical unknowns

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. Apache Doris Integration Patterns
**Decision**: Use Apache Doris as primary OLAP engine with Kafka streaming integration  
**Rationale**: 
- Supports real-time ingestion from Kafka with sub-second latency
- Vectorized execution engine handles complex analytical queries efficiently
- Horizontal scaling matches our 10,000+ TPS requirements
- Native support for star/snowflake schemas for financial analytics

**Alternatives Considered**: 
- ClickHouse: Excellent performance but weaker streaming integration
- Apache Druid: Good for time-series but complex operational overhead
- BigQuery: Vendor lock-in concerns and cost at petabyte scale

**Implementation Notes**: Use Kafka Connect with Doris connector for real-time streaming, batch loading for historical data via S3/Iceberg integration

### 2. Neo4j Performance at Scale
**Decision**: Neo4j Enterprise with clustering for billion+ node graphs  
**Rationale**:
- Causal clustering supports horizontal read scaling for investigation queries
- Cypher query language optimal for graph traversal patterns
- APOC procedures provide advanced algorithms for entity resolution
- Native support for graph algorithms (centrality, community detection)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Amazon Neptune: Vendor lock-in, less mature graph algorithms
- TigerGraph: Better performance but higher complexity and cost
- ArangoDB: Multi-model but weaker graph-specific optimizations

**Implementation Notes**: Use fabric sharding for entity types, read replicas for investigation workloads, write coordination through single leader

### 3. Entity Resolution Algorithms
**Decision**: Hybrid approach using Record Linkage Toolkit (Python) + custom ML models  
**Rationale**:
- Deterministic matching for high-confidence exact matches (SSN, account numbers)
- Probabilistic matching using Fellegi-Sunter model for fuzzy matches
- ML clustering (DBSCAN) for grouping similar entities
- Active learning to improve match quality over time

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Zingg: Open source but limited customization for financial domain
- AWS Entity Resolution: Vendor lock-in and limited control over algorithms
- Dedupe.io: Good library but requires extensive feature engineering

**Implementation Notes**: Use Python service with scikit-learn, pandas, recordlinkage libraries; implement feedback loop for continuous learning

### 4. Kubernetes Service Mesh
**Decision**: Istio for service mesh with observability and security  
**Rationale**:
- mTLS encryption for inter-service communication (compliance requirement)
- Circuit breakers and retries for resilience
- Distributed tracing for debugging complex microservice interactions
- Policy enforcement for zero-trust security model

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Linkerd: Simpler but fewer features for complex enterprise requirements
- Consul Connect: HashiCorp ecosystem but weaker Kubernetes integration
- No service mesh: Direct gRPC but manual security and observability

**Implementation Notes**: Use Istio with Prometheus/Grafana for metrics, Jaeger for tracing, Kiali for service topology visualization

### 5. Iceberg Table Format
**Decision**: Apache Iceberg with S3/GCS for analytical data lake  
**Rationale**:
- Schema evolution without breaking existing queries
- Time travel capabilities for audit and compliance
- Efficient incremental updates for large datasets
- Integration with Apache Doris for analytical workloads

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Delta Lake: Databricks-centric, licensing concerns
- Apache Hudi: Good upsert support but complex operations
- Parquet only: No schema evolution or time travel

**Implementation Notes**: Use Iceberg catalogs in S3, partition by date and entity type, implement compaction strategies for performance

### 6. Financial Crime Compliance
**Decision**: Implement GDPR, PCI-DSS Level 1, and AML compliance framework  
**Rationale**:
- Data minimization and purpose limitation (GDPR Articles 5-6)
- Encryption at rest and in transit (PCI-DSS 3.4, 4.1)
- Audit logging for all data access (AML regulations)
- Right to erasure with cryptographic deletion

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Minimal compliance: Risk of regulatory violations and fines
- Cloud provider compliance: Still requires application-level controls
- Third-party compliance tools: Additional cost and complexity

**Implementation Notes**: Use HashiCorp Vault for key management, implement data classification tags, automated compliance reporting

### 7. Graph Visualization Performance
**Decision**: Cytoscape.js with WebGL renderer for large graph performance  
**Rationale**:
- Handles 10,000+ nodes with acceptable performance (1-2 second render)
- Extensive layout algorithms (force-directed, hierarchical, circular)
- Rich interaction capabilities (zoom, pan, selection, editing)
- Strong TypeScript support and active community

**Alternatives Considered**:
- D3.js: More flexible but requires custom graph handling code
- vis.js: Simpler API but performance limitations with large graphs
- Sigma.js: Good performance but weaker interaction capabilities

**Implementation Notes**: Implement progressive loading, node clustering for large graphs, WebWorkers for layout calculations

### 8. Real-time Stream Processing
**Decision**: Kafka Streams for complex event processing with KSQL for simple analytics  
**Rationale**:
- Native Kafka integration with exactly-once semantics
- Stateful processing for session windows and joins
- Built-in fault tolerance and scaling
- Lower operational complexity than separate stream processor

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Apache Flink: More powerful but higher operational overhead
- Apache Storm: Legacy technology with limited community support
- Kafka Connect only: Limited processing capabilities

**Implementation Notes**: Use Kafka Streams in Go services for low-latency processing, KSQL for ad-hoc analytics, state stores for aggregations

## Architecture Validation Summary

All major architectural decisions have been validated against:
- **Performance Requirements**: 10,000+ TPS ingestion, <200ms query response, 99.9% uptime
- **Scalability Requirements**: Horizontal scaling, petabyte-scale data processing
- **Compliance Requirements**: GDPR, PCI-DSS, AML regulatory compliance
- **Operational Requirements**: 24/7 operation, monitoring, disaster recovery

The three-tier microservices architecture with Kubernetes orchestration provides the necessary scalability, reliability, and compliance capabilities for a financial crimes investigation platform.

**Next Phase**: Proceed to detailed data modeling and API contract design
