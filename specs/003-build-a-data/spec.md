# Feature Specification: Data Intelligence and Investigation Platform

**Feature Branch**: `003-build-a-data`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a data intelligence and investigation platform. This platform is designed for analysts to detect, analyze, and investigate complex activities like money laundering, fraud, business analysis or process automation. It works by ingesting vast amounts of data from disconnected sources (e.g., transaction logs, sanction lists like PEP and OFAC, and customer data, ERP data etc) into a unified system. The core purpose is to connect the dots between disparate pieces of information. The application will automatically resolve entities to create a single, comprehensive view of individuals, organizations or other concepts. It will feature a declarative data modeling system, allowing users to define and apply multiple logical models to the underlying physical data. This enables two primary functions: Automated Alerting: The system will run real-time and batch analyses to automatically identify suspicious patterns and generate high-fidelity risk alerts. Interactive Investigation: Analysts will use a powerful and intuitive graph exploration interface to visually navigate relationships, uncover hidden connections, and explore hypotheses, making investigations faster and more effective."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a financial crimes analyst, I need to investigate potential money laundering activities by connecting transaction patterns across multiple data sources, so that I can identify suspicious behavior and generate compliance reports for regulatory authorities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** multiple disconnected data sources are configured, **When** the system ingests new transaction data, **Then** entities are automatically resolved and relationships are established between individuals, organizations, and transactions
2. **Given** suspicious patterns are detected in real-time, **When** the alerting system identifies potential money laundering, **Then** high-fidelity alerts are generated with supporting evidence and risk scores
3. **Given** an analyst receives an alert, **When** they open the investigation interface, **Then** they can visually explore the entity graph, navigate relationships, and drill down into supporting data
4. **Given** an analyst is exploring connections, **When** they apply different logical data models, **Then** the same underlying data is presented through different analytical lenses
5. **Given** an investigation is complete, **When** the analyst exports findings, **Then** a comprehensive report is generated with evidence chains and compliance documentation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when entity resolution conflicts arise (same person with different names/addresses)?
- How does the system handle data source outages during real-time processing?
- What occurs when alert volumes exceed analyst capacity to investigate?
- How does the system manage privacy and access controls for sensitive financial data?

## Requirements

- **Organization**: Company, bank, or institutional entities with registration details, ownership structures, and operational characteristics  
- **Transaction**: Financial movements with amounts, currencies, timestamps, parties involved, and routing information
- **Account**: Financial accounts linking individuals/organizations with transaction histories and balances
- **Alert**: Risk notifications with severity levels, evidence packages, and investigation status
- **Investigation**: Case records containing analyst activities, findings, and resolution status
- **Data Source**: External system connectors with ingestion rules, schemas, and processing status
- **Risk Pattern**: Configurable rules and models for detecting suspicious activities
- **Sanction List Entry**: Regulatory watch list items with matching criteria and risk classifications
- **Relationship**: Connections between entities with strength indicators, types, and temporal aspects
