## Dependencies
- Infrastructure (T001-T010) before all development
- gRPC contracts and shared components (T019-T027) before service implementation
- Tests (T011-T018) before implementation (T028-T074)
- Backend services (T028-T052) before frontend integration (T060-T068)
- Core frontend (T053-T059) before investigation interface (T060-T068)
- Containerization (T075-T083) before deployment testing (T084-T100)

## Parallel Execution Examples
```
# Launch infrastructure setup together:
Task: "Set up Kubernetes cluster with Istio service mesh"
Task: "Configure Docker registry and container security scanning"
Task: "Provision PostgreSQL 15+ cluster with read replicas"
Task: "Provision Neo4j 5+ cluster with causal clustering"

# Launch contract tests together:
Task: "gRPC contract tests for data-ingestion service"
Task: "gRPC contract tests for entity-resolution service"
Task: "API Gateway contract tests for investigation endpoints"
```

## Constitutional Compliance Validation
Each task must verify compliance with:
- **Data Integrity**: Transactional operations, audit trails, error handling
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capability, performance targets
- **Modular Code**: Loose coupling, clear APIs, maintainable patterns
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E test coverage
- **Consistent UX**: Design system adherence, user-centric workflows

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files/services, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD)
- Commit after each completed task
- Target 80%+ test coverage across all services
- Follow constitutional principles throughout implementation
