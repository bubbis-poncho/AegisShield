# AegisShield Analytics Dashboard - System Integration Testing

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive system integration testing strategy for the AegisShield Analytics Dashboard Service (T037). The testing framework ensures all components work together seamlessly and validates the complete financial crime detection and investigation workflow.

## Testing Architecture

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests** - Individual component testing
2. **Integration Tests** - Service-to-service communication
3. **End-to-End Tests** - Complete workflow validation
4. **Performance Tests** - Load and stress testing
5. **Security Tests** - Authentication and authorization
6. **Real-time Tests** - WebSocket and streaming data

### Test Environment

- **Database**: PostgreSQL (test instance)
- **Cache**: Redis (test database)
- **Message Queue**: Kafka (test topics)
- **Services**: All AegisShield microservices
- **Frontend**: Analytics Dashboard UI

## Test Implementation

### Integration Test Suite

The integration test suite (`integration_test.go`) covers:

- Dashboard CRUD operations
- Widget management and configuration
- Data query execution and caching
- Visualization data processing
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- System health and metrics
- Error handling and edge cases
- Performance and concurrent access

### End-to-End Test Suite

The E2E test suite (`e2e_test.go`) validates:

- Complete financial crime detection workflow
- Service-to-service communication
- Real-time data streaming and updates
- Alert generation and dashboard updates
- Investigation workflow integration
- ML pipeline data integration
- Graph analysis and network visualization
- Compliance report generation

### Test Execution

Use the test runner script to execute comprehensive tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
./run_tests.sh

# Run specific test categories
./run_tests.sh unit
./run_tests.sh integration
./run_tests.sh e2e
./run_tests.sh performance
./run_tests.sh security
```

## Test Scenarios

### Financial Crime Detection Workflow
